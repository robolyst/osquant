# What is this about?

## Free

Scientific knowledge should not be locked behind paywalls or institutional access. At Open Source Quant, we believe that research should be available to anyone with curiosity, not just those with academic affiliations or expensive journal subscriptions.

Making knowledge free helps level the playing field. Whether you're a student in a remote part of the world, a professional pivoting into quant finance, or a hobbyist exploring complex systems for fun, you should be able to access the same ideas, tools, and frameworks as everyone else.

That's why Open Source Quant is, and will always be, free to read and share. No ads, no popups, no nonsense. Just accessible education, delivered clearly.

## Collaborative

Scientific progress doesn't happen in isolation. It happens when people share ideas, question assumptions, and build on each other's work.

At Open Source Quant, we take inspiration from the open-source software community: rapid iteration, transparency by default, and contributions from anyone, anywhere. We aim to bring the same spirit to scientific writing.

Our articles often include code, data, and references to make replication and extension easy. We welcome feedback, corrections, and discussion --- because better ideas emerge when they're pressure-tested in public.

Collaboration isn't just a feature of OSQuant. It's the foundation.

## Iterative

Unlike traditional academic publishing, where papers are frozen in time, OSQuant treats knowledge as a living document.

Science evolves. So should scientific writing.

We revisit and update articles as new insights, techniques, or corrections emerge. This commitment to iteration ensures that the content remains relevant, reliable, and practicalâ€”not just historically accurate.

We believe in:

1. **Timeliness:** Regular updates make sure readers are learning from the most recent research and methods.

2. **Accuracy:** Mistakes happen. Fixing them quickly builds trust and improves the quality of the resource.

3. **Growth:** Iteration reflects intellectual honesty. As we learn more, we revise and invite readers to do the same.

# Who's Behind Open Source Quant?

Hi---I'm Adrian, a researcher and practitioner in quantitative finance.

I started Open Source Quant to create the kind of resource I wish I'd had: practical, honest, and deeply curious. My background blends academia and industry, and I care a lot about clarity, rigor, and sharing ideas in a way that's useful to others.

Most of the articles here are based on my own research, experiments, and reading. Some are deep dives; others are just rough notes I think are worth sharing.

I write under my real name, and I stand by the work.

If you want to connect professionally, learn more about my background, or reach out for collaborations, you can find me on [X.com](https://x.com/DrAdrian) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianletchford/).

# Get Involved

OSQuant is open by design. If something resonates, or something seems off, I'd love to hear from you.

Ways you can contribute:

* **Ask questions.** Confused by something? That's feedback.
* **Spot a mistake?** Open an issue or send a correction; typos, math, logic, anything.
* **Extend an idea.** Found a new way to apply a technique or explain a concept? Let's link it or publish it.
* **Share the work.** If something helps you, consider passing it along and penning an article.

You can reach out via [X.com](https://x.com/DrAdrian), or check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/robolyst/osquant) if you're into code.

Thanks for reading---and welcome to Open Source Quant!
