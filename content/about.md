# Free

Making scientific knowledge free ensures that people around the world, regardless of their location or financial means, can access and contribute to science.

Free to share, free to access.

# Collaborative

We imagine a world where researchers can quickly show their work and build upon each other's work without barriers. Reproducibility is not a problem, it is encouraged. Open sourcing scientific findings accelerates the speed that new discoveries are made and innovations are developed.

# Iterative

Scientific understanding is continually evolving as new discoveries are made. Updating articles with the latest understanding serves crucial purposes:

1. **Latest Information:** Regular updates ensure that the most recent information is accessible to everyone, fostering a globally informed community with up-to-date knowledge.

1. **Error Correction:** Updating allows for the correction of errors and an overall improvement in the accuracy of scientific knowledge.

1. **Culture of Continuous Improvement:** Embracing regular updates cultivates a culture of continuous improvement within the scientific community.
