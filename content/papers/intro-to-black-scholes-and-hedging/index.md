*I'm a little embarrased to admit this, but I was recently in a quant interview and the interviewer quickly realised that I didn't know the Black-Scholes formula by heart! That was definitely a moment when imposter syndrome became reality. To fix the situation, I've written up a piece here on the the Black-Scholes model and how to use it to hedge. I hope this helps you as much as it helps me.*

# Black-Scholes basics

The idea behind the Black-Scholes model is to perfectly hedge the option with a position in the underlying. If the hedge should break even, you can solve for the option's price giving us the Black-Scholes formula.

There are a few different types of option contracts. We'll start with the most basic one; a **European** style **call** option on a stock that **does not pay** dividends.

A European call option gives the purcahser the right to buy a fixed number of shares at a fixed price on a fixed dated.

If you were to buy a call option, and the price of the stock goes up, then the value of the call option also goes up. To hedge this call option so that your total position value doesn't change you would need to sell some number of the stock. We can write such a portfolio like this:
$$
\Pi = V - \Delta S
$$
Where \\( V \\) is the price of the option, \\( S \\) is the price of the stock and \\( \Delta \\) is the number of shares we've sold to hedge the position.

For this portfolio to be "correctly hedged" we do not want it's value to change if the price of the option changes or the price of the stock changes. However, this is not entirely true. We do need to take the time value of money into account. A given amount of value ought to increase over time by the risk free rate. This means that our correctly hedged portfolio should increase in value by the risk free rate. We write this as:
$$
d\Pi = r \Pi dt = dV - \Delta dS
$$
where \\( r\\) is the risk free rate and \\( dt\\) is the amount of time that passes. Since we know the value of the portfolio \\( \Pi \\):
$$
\begin{align}
r (V - \Delta S) dt = dV - \Delta dS \label{1} \tag{1}
\end{align}
$$


The intuition here is that the return on the total position (option + stock) should be equal to the risk free rate. This is what we call an arbitrage free assumption.

The full list of assumptions requried to solve for \\(V\\) are:

1. There exists a risk free asset with a fixed rate of return for the life of the option.
1. The market is arbitrage free.
1. You can borrow and lend any amount of money at the risk free rate.
1. You can buy or sell any amount of the stock. This includes short selling and fractional amounts.
1. There are no transaction costs (no bid-ask spread or commissions).
1. The instantaneous log return of the underlying's price is a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and volatility.

# Deriving the Black-Scholes equation

We're assuming that the price of the stock \\( S \\) follows a [geometric Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion) process with a fixed drift and volatility. This means that the logged prices are a Brownian motion. I find it a little easier to say that the changes in the logged prices are Gaussian with a fixed mean and variance. We write this as:
$$
dS = \mu S dt \pm \sigma S d W
$$
where \\( \mu \\) is the mean of the stock's returns, \\( \sigma \\) is the volatility and \\(dW\\) is the change in a Brownian motion (standard Gaussian).

As for \\( dV \\), all we know at the moment is that V is a function of the price of the stock \\( S \\) and time \\( t \\). As luck would have it, very smart people have already figured out what a function of a stochastic process and time looks like. It么's lemma tells us [^ito]. Deriving this takes a bit of time, so we're just going to consider it magical and jump straight into the formula for \\( dV \\).

Using It么's lemma we can break down \\( dV \\):
$$
dV = \frac{\delta V}{\delta t} dt + \frac{\delta V}{\delta S} dS + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2S^2\frac{\delta^2 V}{\delta S^2} dt
$$

Substituting this into Eq. (\\( \ref{1} \\)) gives us:
$$
r (V - \Delta S) dt = \left(\frac{\delta V}{\delta t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2S^2\frac{\delta^2 V}{\delta S^2} \right) dt + \left(\frac{\delta V}{\delta S} - \Delta \right) dS
$$

If we want the number of shares sold \\( \Delta \\) to exactly offset any change in \\( V \\), then we can imply that:
$$
\Delta = \frac{\delta V}{\delta S}
$$
substituting this in and cancelling out the \\( dt \\) term we get:
$$
\begin{align}
r \left( V - \frac{\delta V}{\delta S} S \right) = \frac{\delta V}{\delta t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2S^2\frac{\delta^2 V}{\delta S^2} \label{2}\tag{2}
\end{align}
$$

# Intuition behind the equation

Equation (\\(\ref{2}\\)) looks pretty intimidating. The left hand side is just the amount of money we should make if we just invested in the risk free asset. The left right hand side says that this should equal the amount of money gained/lossed over time plus any money gained/lossed by the price movement in the stock.

[^ito]: It么's lemma. If \\( X_t \\) is a stochastic process with infinitesimal variance \\(v(X_t)\\) and if \\( u(X_t, t) \\) is a function with enough derivatives then \\( u(X_t, t) \\) is another stochastic process that satisfies:
$$
d u(X_t, t) = \frac{\delta u(X_t, t)}{\delta t} dt + \frac{\delta u(X_t, t)}{\delta X_t} d X_t + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\delta^2 u(X_t, t)}{\delta X_t^2} v(X_t)dt
$$
