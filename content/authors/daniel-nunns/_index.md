I'm a quantitative trader. Since 2020, I've worked in financial companies ranging from options market making, through to commodities trading. I enjoy creating robust systems to allow me to capture edge, whether that's through statistical means, or engaging in physical asset modelling to forecast the future flows of energy around the world.
