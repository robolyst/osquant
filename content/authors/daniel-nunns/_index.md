I'm a quantitative developer. I currently work for a leading hedge fund. I've previously worked as a university researcher, data scientist, full stack engineer, data engineer, analytics engineer and head of data. I started Open Source Quant because, after my experience in academia, I wish to see a kinder scientific publishing industry.

I'm a quantitative trader. Since 2020, I've worked in financial companies ranging from options market making, through to commodities trading. I enjoy creating robust systems to allow me to capture edge, whether that's through statistical means, or engaging in physical asset modelling to forecast the future flows of energy around the world.
