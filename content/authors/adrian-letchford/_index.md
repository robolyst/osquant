I'm a quantitative developer. I currently work for a leading hedge fund. I've previously worked as a university researcher, data scientist, full stack engineer, data engineer, analytics engineer and head of data. I started Open Source Quant because, after my experience in academia, I wish to see a kinder scientific publishing industry.
